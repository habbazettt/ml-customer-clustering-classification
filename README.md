# BMLP Final Submission - Clustering & Classification Projects

This repository contains two machine learning projects submitted as the final assignment for the Dicoding Beginner Machine Learning Course. It consists of two parts: **Clustering** (Unsupervised Learning) and **Classification** (Supervised Learning with Deep Learning). Each part is implemented in a separate Jupyter Notebook.

## 📘 Project Description

This project aims to explore and apply machine learning techniques to real-world financial transaction data. It is divided into two core parts:

### 🧠 Clustering (Unsupervised Learning)

The clustering task focuses on analyzing customer transaction behavior. By using unsupervised learning algorithms such as K-Means, Agglomerative Clustering, and DBSCAN, the project groups customers based on patterns in their transaction data.

The dataset includes the following features:

- Transaction amount and duration
- Transaction type (Credit/Debit), channel (ATM/Online), and location
- Customer age and occupation
- Login attempts and account balance

These features are used to understand customer behavior and segment them into meaningful groups, which can be useful for targeted marketing, fraud detection, and customer service optimization.

### 🧾 Classification (Supervised Learning)

The classification task involves training a deep learning model to classify images using a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. It demonstrates how CNNs can be used to effectively identify patterns in image datasets, commonly applied in areas such as facial expression recognition, object detection, and more.
